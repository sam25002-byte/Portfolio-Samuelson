    <h1>Client Report</h1>
    <br>
    <p>As client: <br>
        I decided to use informational content and images 
        for my site because it is an informational site. <br>
        I didnt really have good connection with my lead dev, 
        but he was able to make a good product. <br>
        The developer did meet my expectiations for the site. <br>
        If I were to do this again, I would allow the developers to 
        use AI as long as they thoroughly double check everything. <br>

        As a lead dev: <br>
        I was not the best with communication, and I paid the price trying to 
        connect 2 css pages. After a few hours, I gave up because the site still 
        worked. <br>
        There were a few times where I had issues finding the main branch 
        because it got renamed somehow, until I felt like crying a little. When I 
        finally got the site up late at night, it didnt work until I force-reloaded 
        the page. Those were some really stressful moments as I thought it didnt work. <br>

        As a junior dev: <br>
        One of the projects went great, as far as turning it late can go, and the other went 
        poorly. I wasnt even able to connect to the github repository until a week or two into the 
        assignment and had to go ask them to add me. At that point, the lead dev still hadnt 
        contacted me, so when I looked, they had already done everything entirely by
        themselves. the other one that went well had good communication and sent me the stuff, but 
        the styles.css was kind of messed up, so I had to spend a long time figuring out what was 
        causing which issues. <br>

        Reflection: <br>
        a few of the most challenging parts of this project, besides not being familiar with github 
        and general github procedure would be working with other people who also doent know. What I 
        mean by that is having issues using the same css and knowing coding best practices so that 
        you can work well with teams. because we arent familiar with this, there was a lot of 
        struggling where one person made a trait too broad, and since I wasnt comfortable changing 
        their stuff, had to work around it. If I were to do this again, I would want to work with 
        people I am more familiar with so that I can better give suggestions and communicate with 
        them instead of a complete stranger who just happened to take the same class as me. Overall 
        though, it has been pretty fun and it is good to know more about what real-world coding is 
        meant to look like by doing it wrong.
