        Who am I:<br>
        My name is Ethan Cornelius Samuelson, I am 18 years old, and am currently going to my first 
        semester of college.<br>
        I lived in Chubbuck Idaho growing up, and moved to Jackson Hole Wyoming during the summer for my father's job.<br>
        I went to Pocatello Elementary, Hawthorn Middle School, then Pocatello High School.<br>
        I have 3 younger brothers, 3 cats, 1 dog, 60 cousins, and 13 aunts and uncles.<br>
        <br>
        I got into programming in high school, when I took an Intro to Programming class as well as 
        a cybersecurity course. I found that I really enjoyed programming and was pretty
        good at it.<br>
